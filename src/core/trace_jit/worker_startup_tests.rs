//! Production startup of the native-region worker, observed from real processes.
//!
//! A unit test cannot answer the question these cover. Inside a test binary
//! `TraceJit::new` returns early with one deterministic configuration and no
//! worker, so a test that constructs a `TraceJit` never performs the
//! environment read nor the worker start that a production process performs.
//! Re-executing the test binary does not help by itself: the child is another
//! test binary and takes the same early return.
//!
//! So each case re-executes this binary with `M68K_STARTUP_PROBE` set, which is
//! the one thing that early return consults. From that point the child runs
//! `TraceJit::new_production`, which is the constructor the program itself
//! runs: the same environment read, the same mode selection, the same worker
//! start, and then the same recorder, promotion, background publication and
//! region entry, all driven through the public `run_batch`. The child reports
//! what it observed and the parent judges it.
//!
//! Nothing here treats a live thread or an enabled flag as evidence. A region
//! is only reported as having run when the region entry counter moved, and a
//! publication is only reported when the status the worker's own poll path
//! sets has been seen.
//!
//! Each child runs two phases. The warmup is allowed to differ — an enabled
//! child stops as soon as it has published and entered a region, a disabled
//! child has nothing to wait for and runs its whole budget — and nothing
//! observed during it is compared. The measurement that follows is identical in
//! every child: the same guest reset, the same batch count, the same
//! instruction budget, no early exit. Only that phase's retired count, register
//! digest and guest memory are compared across cases, so equivalence is a claim
//! about the same work, not about whatever each child happened to do.
