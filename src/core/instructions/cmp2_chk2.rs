//! 68020+ CMP2 / CHK2 (bounds compare / bounds check).
//!
//! Based on the Musashi mc68040 test suite sources in
//! `tests/fixtures/Musashi/test/mc68040/{cmp2,chk2}.s`.
//!
//! Encoding (as used by GNU as for 68040):
//!   opcode: 0000 0ss0 11 mmm rrr   (ss: 00=byte, 01=word, 10=long)
//!   ext word:
//!     - bit 11: 1 = CHK2 (may trap), 0 = CMP2
//!     - bits 15..12: register specifier (0..7 = D0..D7, 8..15 = A0..A7)
//!     - remaining bits unused in our fixtures
//!
//! Semantics (as required by the fixture):
//! - Reads a lower and upper bound from `<ea>` (two consecutive sized values).
//! - Compares the specified register value against the bounds.
//! - Sets C=1 when the value is out of range, else C=0.
//! - For CHK2, triggers CHK exception (vector 6) when out of range.
//!
//! Note: The Musashi fixture expects CMP2.B to behave using unsigned comparisons for bounds/operand.
