//! PMMU emulation for the M68030, M68040, and M68060.
//!
//! The 68030 path implements its programmable multi-level table format,
//! CRP/SRP selection, function-code lookup, transparent translation, PTEST,
//! and accumulated write/supervisor protection. The 68040 and 68060 use the
//! fixed root/pointer/page table format, instruction/data transparent
//! translation registers, and a direct-mapped address-translation cache.
//!
//! Table-walk bus errors and protection failures retain enough cause detail
//! for generation-specific exception frames. Used/modified descriptor
//! write-back, 68030 root-descriptor limit checks, and a DT=1 page descriptor
//! directly in the 68030 root pointer are not modeled.
